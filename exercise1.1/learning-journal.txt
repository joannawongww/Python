Reflection questions
1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
Frontend development is about what a user sees and interacts with an application.
Backend development is about server API, data storage and business logic. 
If I am hired, likely to be working on the databases, APIs, authentication/authorization.

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
Both Python and Javascript are high-level scripting language and uses dynamic typing.  
Key benefit of Python is its readiability, allowing developers to understand the code easily. This also helps to keep code error resistant. 


3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?
I hope to improve my knowledge on object-oriented programming.  
I hope to learn more on python pip installations.
I hope to learn more on automation of tasks using Python.
